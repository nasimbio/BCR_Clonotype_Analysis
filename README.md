# BCR Clonotype Analysis from Single-Cell RNA-seq

This project analyzes B cell receptor (BCR) sequences from single-cell RNA-seq data using the V(D)J output generated by the Cell Ranger pipeline. The goal is to assess immunoglobulin chain usage and clonotype frequency.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This analysis extracts and summarizes BCR clonotype information from 10x Genomics single-cell V(D)J sequencing data. The input includes:
- `all_contig_annotations.csv` to identify and separate immunoglobulin heavy (IGH), kappa (IGK), and lambda (IGL) chains
- `clonotypes.csv` to quantify and visualize clonotype frequency and chain usage


---

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Tasks

### **Task 1: Parsing and Saving Immunoglobulin Chain Data**
- Read `all_contig_annotations.csv` from Cell Ranger VDJ output
- Filter and extract entries for:
  - **IGH** (immunoglobulin heavy chain)
  - **IGK** (kappa light chain)
  - **IGL** (lambda light chain)
- Save each chain as a separate CSV for downstream analysis

### **Task 2: Clonotype Frequency and Chain Usage Visualization**
- Read `clonotypes.csv` and count occurrences of each clonotype
- Visualize **clonotype frequencies** using bar plots
- Calculate the proportion of IGK, IGL, and IGH chain usage across clonotypes
- Create **pie plots** to illustrate the distribution of immunoglobulin light and heavy chains

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Raw data is not publicly available due to client ownership and confidentiality.
- Some example outputs plots are organized by task in the `output/` folder.
- This project is designed for both reproducibility and clarity.
